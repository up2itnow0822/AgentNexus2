## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

**As a grant committee evaluator**, I need to see that AgentNexus:
1. Delivers technical innovation (ERC-4337 AA + A2A payments)
2. Demonstrates traction (5,000 users, $200K monthly volume)
3. Builds ecosystem (100+ developers, 20 production agents)
4. Creates public good (open-source A2A protocol)
5. Positions Base as agent economy hub

**Success Criteria:**
- Base Ecosystem Fund approval ($150K) by Week 4
- Featured in Base ecosystem showcase by Week 8
- Coinbase Ventures interest ($500K-2M) by Week 12

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Base Ecosystem Fund Grant Application (Week 4)
**Given:**
- 5 agents deployed (25% of V1 spec)
- 50 beta users onboarded
- ERC-4337 smart wallets operational
- $1K testnet transaction volume
- Demo video showcasing gasless UX

**When:** Submit Base Ecosystem Fund application

**Then:**
- Application includes working Base Sepolia prototype
- Technical innovation score: 9/10 (ERC-4337 + containerized agents)
- Ecosystem impact score: 8/10 (enables agent developers)
- Fundability assessment: HIGHLY FUNDABLE (8.7/10)
- Expected outcome: $150K grant approval (90% probability)

#### Scenario 2: Developer Ecosystem Proof (Week 8)
**Given:**
- 11 agents deployed (55% of V1 spec)
- 500 active users
- 20 developers in ecosystem
- Hyperliquid + Aster DeFi integrations
- Cross-chain operational (Base + Arbitrum + Polygon)
- $10K mainnet transaction volume

**When:** Measure developer ecosystem growth

**Then:**
- 3rd-party developers publishing agents
- Developer workshop/hackathon completed
- First enterprise customer signed
- Featured in Base blog/showcase
- Positioned for Coinbase Ventures pitch

#### Scenario 3: Category Leadership & Series A Positioning (Week 12)
**Given:**
- 20 agents deployed (100% of V1 spec) 🎯
- 5,000 active users
- 100+ developers in ecosystem
- $200K monthly transaction volume
- A2A payment protocol open-sourced
- Cross-chain operational (4 networks)
- Media coverage (Bankless, The Defiant)

**When:** Pitch to Coinbase Ventures

**Then:**
- Industry-first A2A payment protocol demonstrated
- Base ecosystem leadership established
- Path to $500K monthly volume visible
- Positioned as category-defining company
- Series A funding pipeline: $500K-2M (60% probability)

### Edge Cases

#### Edge Case 1: Grant Application Rejected
**Scenario:** Base Ecosystem Fund rejects application despite 8.7/10 score

**Mitigation:**
- Pivot to Protocol Guild ($25K-75K, faster approval)
- Double down on open-source contributions
- Apply to Optimism RetroPGF Round 5
- Continue execution with existing capital
- Re-apply next quarter with stronger traction

#### Edge Case 2: Developer Adoption Below Target
**Scenario:** Only 10 developers join by Week 8 (target: 20)

**Mitigation:**
- Increase developer incentives (grants, bounties)
- Host additional hackathons
- Partner with developer bootcamps
- Create "Agent Accelerator" program
- Directly recruit from AI/blockchain communities

#### Edge Case 3: Technical Delays in Cross-Chain Integration
**Scenario:** Cross-chain bridge deployment delayed beyond Week 8

**Mitigation:**
- Launch Base-only initially
- Use existing bridge infrastructure (LayerZero, Wormhole)
- Deprioritize non-Base chains for V1
- Announce cross-chain as V1.1 feature
- Focus grant narrative on Base-first strategy

#### Edge Case 4: Competition Emerges
**Scenario:** Competitor launches similar A2A marketplace during 12-week period

**Mitigation:**
- Accelerate unique features (A2A protocol, invisible AA)
- Secure Base ecosystem partnership for exclusivity
- Emphasize first-mover advantage in grant applications
- Patent/protect A2A payment protocol IP
- Build moat through network effects (users + developers)

#### Edge Case 5: Bear Market / Crypto Winter
**Scenario:** Crypto market downturn reduces user acquisition and volume

**Mitigation:**
- Focus on utility agents (productivity, not speculation)
- Emphasize stablecoin payments (USDC)
- Target enterprise customers (less price-sensitive)
- Position as cost-saving infrastructure
- Secure grants before volume drops
