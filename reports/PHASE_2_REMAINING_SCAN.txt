./reports/PHASE_2_CHECKPOINT.md:3:- Objective: Remove AstraForge and unrelated elements; preserve AgentNexus2 and Agent Zero.
./reports/PHASE_2_CHECKPOINT.md:5:  - Deleted AstraForge-only docs/scripts.
./reports/PHASE_2_CHECKPOINT.md:6:  - Scrubbed AstraForge branding from remaining documents.
./reports/EVALUATION_REPORT.md:4:The repository has been refined to remove AstraForge-specific artifacts while preserving AgentNexus2 and Agent Zero. Architecture, contracts (Escrow, Entitlements), backend orchestrator (TypeScript/Express), frontend (Next.js), and smart-contract toolchain (Foundry) align strongly with PROJECT_SPEC. Base chain is established as primary network with a multi-chain roadmap (Arbitrum, Optimism, Ethereum) intact.
