# Phase 2 Checkpoint

- Objective: Remove AstraForge and unrelated elements; preserve AgentNexus2 and Agent Zero.
- Actions:
  - Deleted AstraForge-only docs/scripts.
  - Scrubbed AstraForge branding from remaining documents.
  - Updated README to state Base chain as primary while remaining multi-chain.
- Functional Safety:
  - No source logic changed; only docs/comments.
  - Next step: optional smoke build in CI or local dev to confirm no incidental doc references block scripts.
